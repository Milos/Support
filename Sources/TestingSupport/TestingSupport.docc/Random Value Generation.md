# Random Value Generation

Convenient extensions for generating random values of certain types.

## Overview

Extensions on `Data`, `String`, and `UUID` provide a static extension method, `random()`, that generates new random
values of these types.

Often these can be used in testing in place of random hand-created values to better represent the fact that the case is
chosen at random and has no significant meaning.
